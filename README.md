# Harvard Commencement Speeches: Historical Context and Themes
## Motivation
Every year, Harvard hosts a notable speaker to deliver a commencement speech as part of the graduation ceremony. In the last twenty years, icons from Bill Gates to Oprah Winfrey have spoken to the graduating students and have covered a variety of topics to jumpstart the class’ post-academic, “real world” lives. Our group sought to understand what, if any, correlation existed between these speakers’ words and the situation in the world at large: what is the final call to action, final image of what a Harvard student should be like and how does this change as the world changes?  An understanding of these ideas reflects not only which global topics are the most salient and pressing, but our responsibilities as students to act on them.
