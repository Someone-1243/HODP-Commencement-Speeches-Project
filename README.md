# Harvard Commencement Speeches: Historical Context and Themes
This project is a comp project for the Harvard College Open Data Project.

## Project Objective
Our group sought to understand what, if any, correlation existed between the content of Harvard commencement speeches and the situation in the world at large: what is the final call to action, final image of what a Harvard student should be like, and how does this change as the world changes?  An understanding of these ideas reflects not only which global topics are the most salient and pressing, but our responsibilities as students to act on them. 

## Methodology
Data was collected from commencement speech transcripts from 2000 - 2020, with the exclusion of 2001, 2003, and 2006, for which no accurate transcripts could be found. This was then quantified and analyzed using Text Analytics from Microsoft Azure. The data on speeches was compared to web-based search data, namely from Google Trends and Wikipediaâ€™s Timeline of the 21st Century. Data analysis and visualization was done in Python.
